# Clustering Methods in R

This repository contains an R script for applying various clustering techniques to different datasets. The script allows users to select a dataset by uncommenting the desired URL.
It provides visualization tools and computes cluster quality metrics to assess clustering performance. 

# The script fits multiple clustering methods, categorized as follows:

- **Centroid-based clustering**: K-Means  
- **Hierarchical-based clustering**: Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC)  
- **Distribution-based clustering**: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)  
- **Density-based clustering**: OPTICS & HDBSCAN

# Choosing optimal number of clusters

Clustering algorithms whereby it is necessary to determine the number of clusters beforehand have a comment with a suggestion on how to do so.
